# Simple-Java-MineSweeper
A simplistic version of minesweeper made in java, using jframe as the graphics engine.

The reason I chose java was that is it a language I am extremely familiar with, however I have never really used Jframes, so I wanted an excuse to learn how they work.
Furthermore the object oriented nature of the java fit really nicely with how much data i wanted to store per tile, so I made a Tile class, and the back end of the board is that its a 2d array of Tile Objects.
